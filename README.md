# MERN Stack Project

This is a simple MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack project template. It demonstrates the use of the MERN stack to build a web application. This README provides an overview of the project structure, dependencies, and instructions on how to run the code locally.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main components: the frontend (React) and the backend (Node.js). Here's an overview of the project structure:

- **Frontend** (located in the root directory)
  - `src/`: Contains the React frontend source code.
  - `package.json`: Lists frontend dependencies.
  - `README.md`: This README file.
  
- **Backend** (located in a separate "server" directory)
  - `server/`: Contains the Node.js backend source code.
  - `package.json`: Lists backend dependencies.
  - `README.md`: Documentation specific to the backend.

## Frontend Dependencies

The frontend of this MERN project relies on the following key dependencies:

- `axios`: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- `moment`: A JavaScript library for parsing and formatting dates and times.
- `react`: The core library for building the user interface.
- `react-dom`: The React library for DOM rendering.
- `react-router-dom`: A library for managing routing in React applications.
- `react-scripts`: A set of scripts for setting up and managing React development environments.
- `react-toastify`: A library for displaying notifications and toasts.
- `web-vitals`: A package for tracking and reporting web performance metrics.
  
These dependencies help in building the frontend components, handling API requests, and managing the user interface.

## Backend Dependencies

The backend of this MERN project relies on the following key dependencies:

- `bcrypt`: A library for hashing and salting passwords securely.
- `cors`: Middleware for enabling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in Express.js applications.
- `express`: A web application framework for Node.js.
- `express-validator`: A library for handling request validation and sanitization in Express.js.
- `jsonwebtoken`: A library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
- `mongoose`: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- `nodemon`: A development tool for automatically restarting the Node.js server during development.

These dependencies are essential for building the server, defining routes, interacting with the database, and ensuring secure authentication.

## Getting Started

To run this MERN stack project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.
- MongoDB should be installed and running. Configure the database connection in the backend.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory using your terminal.
   - Install frontend dependencies by running:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the development server with:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   - The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the server directory using your terminal.
   - Install backend dependencies by running:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the Node.js server in development mode with:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

   - The backend server will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Make sure to configure your MongoDB connection settings and JWT secret in the backend's configuration files (not included in this template).

## Styling

For styling, this project uses Bootstrap Morph. Additional CSS files or styling libraries can be added as needed to customize the appearance of your application.

This project template provides a solid foundation for building a full-stack web application using the MERN stack. You can expand upon it by adding more features, enhancing the user interface, and deploying it to a hosting platform of your choice.
